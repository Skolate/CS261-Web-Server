## User Interface
Uses Materialize CSS as a CSS framework. The folders "css", "js" and "fonts" belong to Materialize. The UI doesn't rely on CDNs for Materialize, as the files are locally available, but uses one CDN for Google's Material Icon font (meaning there will be display problems when the user is not online)
